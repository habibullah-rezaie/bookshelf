              "description": "Lavishly illustrated with over 300 pictures, including more than 200 in full color, The Oxford History of Islam offers the most wide-ranging and authoritative account available of the second largest--and fastest growing--religion in the world. John L. Esposito, Editor-in-Chief of the four-volume Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World, has gathered together sixteen leading scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, to examine the origins and historical development of Islam--its faith, community, institutions, sciences, and arts. Beginning in the pre-Islamic Arab world, the chapters range from the story of Muhammad and his Companions, to the development of Islamic religion and culture and the empires that grew from it, to the influence that Islam has on today's world. The book covers a wide array of subjects, casting light on topics such as the historical encounter of Islam and Christianity, the role of Islam in the Mughal and Ottoman empires, the growth of Islam in Southeast Asia, China, and Africa, the political, economic, and religious challenges of European imperialism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and Islamic communities in the modern Western world. In addition, the book offers excellent articles on Islamic religion, art and architecture, and sciences as well as bibliographies. Events in the contemporary world have led to an explosion of interest and scholarly work on Islam. Written for the general reader but also appealing to specialists, The Oxford History of Islam offers the best of that recent scholarship, presented in a readable style and complemented by a rich variety of illustrations.",

Naturally, readers will find many entries on topics of intense current interest, such as terrorism and the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, the PLO and HAMAS. But the coverage goes well beyond recent headlines. There are biographical profiles, ranging from Naguib Mahfouz (the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt) to Malcolm X, including political leaders, influential thinkers, poets, scientists, and writers. Other entries cover major political movements, militant groups, and religious sects as well as terms from Islamic law, culture, and religion, key historical events, and important landmarks (such as Mecca and Medina). A series of entries looks at Islam in individual nations, such as Afghanistan, the West Bank and Gaza, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the United States, and the",

              "description": "'Read! Your Lord is the Most Bountiful one who taught by the pen, who taught man what he did not know.' The Qur'an, believed by Muslims to be the word of God, was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad 1400 years ago. It is the supreme authority in Islam and the living source of all Islamic teaching; it is a sacred text and a book of guidance, that sets out the creed, rituals, ethics, and laws of the Islamic religion. It has been one of the most influential books in the history of literature. Recognized as the greatest literary masterpiece in Arabic, it has nevertheless remained difficult to understand in its English translations. This new translation is written in a contemporary idiom that remains faithful to the original, making it easy to read while retaining its powers of eloquence. Archaisms and cryptic language are avoided, and the Arabic meaning preserved by respecting the context of the discourse. The message of the Qur'an was directly addressed to all people regardless of class, gender, or age, and this translation is equally accessible to everyone. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.",

It is not a compilation of country profiles but rather a unique analytical review of the state of knowledge about Islam and Muslim in different European countries, as well as on thematic issues such as Hijab, Sharia, or Islamophobia. For this reason, it will remain relevant beyond the continuous flow of eventsthat rapidly make obsolete other sorts of compilation. It is also the first time, that Western and Eastern Europe are systematically analyzed together in one volume on the question of Islam, bringing to light similarities and also differences in the status of Muslims in these different parts of Europe.",

He uses these immediate and tangible structures to introduce teachings, practices, values and issues central to this rich and fascinating world faith, including: -- prayer, worship and pilgrimage -- gender and community -- technology and religion -- challenges and opportunities in the 21st century. This is a thought-provoking and accessible exploration of the key elements of Islam for students, Muslims seeking a new perspective on their faith, and all those interested in the study of religion in the world today.",

Johnstown was a bustling community of hardworking people dedicated to the community and to each other. Enter the rich people from Pittsburgh and other parts of Pennsylvania seeking a refuge from the stresses of the business life. They establish a resort above Johnstown in the peaceful mountains near the small village of South Fork. Mary and James struggle to overcome these conflicts and be true to their love. As their love rises to new heights, so too does the peaceful lake they visit. Too soon, both come together in a climax as the dam breaks and the floodwaters rush towards Johnstown. The reader is driven along with the flood towards its final reckoning. Now all that awaits is destiny, for Mary, for James and for the people of Johnstown, Pennsylvania on that fateful day of May 31, 1889.",

But when Harriet decides to follow her footsteps to fight for social justice, she certainly never expected her efforts to land her in jail. Nor did she expect her childhood enemy and notorious school bully, Tommy O'Reilly, to be the arresting officer. Languishing in a jail cell, Harriet has plenty of time to sift through the memories of the three generations of women who have preceded her. As each story emerges, the strength of her family--and their deep faith in the God of justice and righteousness--brings Harriet to discovery of her own goals and motives for pursuing them.",

When an army of bandits descends on them, the Amish are saved by the last-minute arrival of government troops. But they soon learn that soldiers can be as cruel as the bandits themselves.

As Caleb's frail hope of peace and freedom in Mexico slips away, he is left to ponder the question: In times of trouble, on whom should we rely?",

              "description": "An eye-opening analysis of collegiate activism and its effects on the divisions in contemporary American politics. The past six years have been marked by a contentious political atmosphere that has touched every arena of public life, including higher education. Though most college campuses are considered ideologically progressive, how can it be that the right has been so successful in mobilizing young people even in these environments? As Amy J. Binder and Jeffrey L. Kidder show in this surprising analysis of the relationship between political activism on college campuses and the broader US political landscape, while liberal students often outnumber conservatives on college campuses, liberal campus organizing remains removed from national institutions that effectively engage students after graduation. And though they are usually in the minority, conservative student groups have strong ties to national right-leaning organizations, which provide funds and expertise, as well as job opportunities and avenues for involvement after graduation. Though the left is more prominent on campus, the right has built a much more effective system for mobilizing ongoing engagement. What’s more, the conservative college ecosystem has worked to increase the number of political provocations on campus and lower the public’s trust in higher education. In analyzing collegiate activism from the left, right, and center, The Channels of Student Activism shows exactly how politically engaged college students are channeled into two distinct forms of mobilization and why that has profound consequences for the future of American politics.",

              "description": "The true story of a living kidney donor and recipient’s unbreakable bond Imagine suffering with an unrelenting disease your whole life, only to be rescued by a childhood friend, a relative who wants to be a conduit for healing no matter what. Both individuals struggle with life but in vastly different ways—Ironically, Tina wants to die, even though she lives, and Brian wants to live, even though he dies. They come together to experience a miracle of God through the kidney that unites them. Brian lives nine extra years, dying of diabetic complications, not kidney failure. The doctors exclaim that the kidney is still completely viable at death. Meet small-town writer Tina Shyver-Plank, who penned this compelling memoir about her gift of a kidney to her dying cousin, Brian Shyver, who has juvenile-onset type 1 diabetes from the age six years old. She is depressed and finds life painful, while he fights ardently with every step to survive. After the donation, Brian gets a fire in his spirit for religion, and Tina finds the strength to live. You will cry with them, and you will laugh with them on their inspiring journey through life together, apart, and together again. It's a complex interplay of ups and downs, as the donation and their lives make an indelible mark on countless others. “Since the struggles in life build character,” as Tina often puts it, you will come to understand that these two individuals grow up fast and offer a prayer of thanks to the God whom made them. SECOND CHANCE is an uplifting memoir that will move the spirit and immerse the soul in the nuances of life. This cathartic story ushers the reader into a kaleidoscope of experiences, both riveting and triumphant.",

Everyone knows Midwesterners are salt-of-the-earth folk defined by their goodness, niceness, and politeness . . . right?. In this funny, wide-ranging collection, Mia Mercado ponders her identity as an Asian woman living in the Midwest, including what “nice” means—and why anyone would want to be it. Drawing on a wide range of subjects, including her body, her dog, trash reality television, bizarre Tweets from strangers, and her high school science teacher, she uncovers weird, long-overdue truths about ourselves, our frailty, and our failings—seeing them not as a source of shame but a cause for celebration. She’s Nice Though offers a mind-bending glimpse into our misperceptions and misconceptions as humans, as viewed by a razor-sharp cultural critic, hilarious millennial content queen, and expert essayist with a unique voice and a gift for detail. Like Jia Tolentino's Trick Mirror, Michelle Zauner's Crying in H-Mart, and Samantha Irby’s Wow No Thank You, Mia’s humorous myth-busting second book reflects the illusions and delusions of contemporary life—and who we really are.",

Widespread male migration has important effects on Nepalese society. How institutions such as Water Users’ Associations (WUAs) respond and adapt, is therefore critical to the understanding of rural transformation and the likely impact on gender equality, food production, and rural livelihoods. This paper examines the effects of male migration on institutional change in WUAs, women’s roles, technological change, and outcomes affecting effectiveness of irrigation systems based on a mixed methods study, combining a phone survey of 336 WUA leaders from all provinces in Nepal with qualitative data from case studies in 10 irrigation systems. Results indicate WUAs have adapted rules to increase women’s participation and monetize the contributions for maintenance. Women exercise agency in whether and how to interact with WUAs. Mechanization has reduced the need for some male labor, though the ability to mechanize is limited by hilly terrain and small plot sizes. Overall, systems are adapting to male migration, with relatively low idling of land or labor shortages causing deterioration of the systems, though there are concerns with the high levels of women’s labor burdens.",

Enter the richly-imagined tropical world of Damsport and dive into rollicking adventures that are packed with unforgettable characters and snappy dialogue, served up with lashes of humour. DESCRIPTION OF BOOK 1: The Bloodless Assassin As a skinny, dreadlocked girl who grew up on the street making her living as a pickpocket, Rory isn’t exactly a prime candidate for swordmasters to take on as a student. Especially since she can’t pay them. So what’s a girl to do when she dreams of becoming a great sword fighter and adventurer? Blackmail an assassin into taking her as an apprentice, that’s what. Things don’t go according to plan, though. Rory’s new master, Longinus, has more eccentricities than a stray dog has fleas and he’s so frustrating to deal with, she frequently wants to bang her head against a brick wall. They have to put their arguments aside, though, when they both find themselves targeted by a plot aiming to destroy the city. Now not only does Rory have to figure out how to keep herself and Longinus alive, she also has to stop the conspiracy. An impossible task? It’s even harder with Longinus under the delusion that he’s the hero of the story. That would be funny, if it didn't make Rory want to throttle him. Follow along with Rory and Longinus’s unlikely friendship and see how on earth the two misfits get themselves out of trouble. Grab the complete series now.",

He can’t help but be drawn to women who blink up at him with ditzy doe-eyes and are TSTL. Their love isn’t just dark, it’s twisted. Because she has a secret. And so does he.
